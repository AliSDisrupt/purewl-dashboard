**Analysis & Next Steps:**

Retention metrics require longer-term tracking (7-day, 30-day retention). Current focus is on acquisition and activation stages. Retention analysis needs cohort-based tracking over multiple weeks.

2. **Create referral program** with incentives for both referrer and referee
3. **Add social sharing buttons** to key pages (case studies, blog posts, pricing)

**Pipeline Health:**

**Next Steps:**
1. **Continue nurturing active pipeline deals** - Regular follow-ups and value delivery
2. **Focus on deals in late stages** (Proposal, Negotiation) - Highest probability of close
3. **Identify and address stuck deals** - Deals in same stage >14 days need attention
4. **Optimize sales process** to reduce time-to-close
5. **Track deal sources** to identify highest-converting channels
6. **Implement sales enablement** tools to accelerate deal progression
